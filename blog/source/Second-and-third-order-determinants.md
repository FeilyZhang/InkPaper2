# Ⅰ. Second-order determinant

Let a<sub>11</sub>, a<sub>12</sub>, a<sub>21</sub>, a<sub>22</sub> be four numbers, we call

![Second-order determinant](/images/article/second-order determinant.png)

is a second-order determinant, where each number a<sub>ij</sub> is called an element. And where the subscripts i and j are the row and column labels of the element, respectively. a<sub>11</sub>, a<sub>22</sub> are the main diagonal elements and a<sub>12</sub>, a<sub>21</sub> are minor diagonal elements.

The value of the second-order determinant is equal to the product of the main diagonals minus the product of the second diagonal elements. This is the diagonal rule of the second order determinant.

# Ⅱ. Third-order determinant

Analogously, we call

![Third-order determinant](/images/article/third-order determinant.png)

is a third-order determinant. Its operation still obeys the diagonal rule.
